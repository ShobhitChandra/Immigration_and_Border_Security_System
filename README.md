## **📂 Project Structure**  
The project consists of the following components:  

1. **📄 Relational Schema** – Defines tables, attributes, and relationships.  
2. **📊 ER Diagram** – Visual representation of entities and their relationships.  
3. **🔧 DDL (Data Definition Language)** – SQL scripts for table creation, constraints, and indexes.  
4. **📝 DML (Data Manipulation Language)** – SQL queries for inserting, updating, and deleting data.  
5. **🔍 Complex Queries** – Advanced SQL queries for analytics and reporting.

## **🚀 Setup & Installation**  
1. **Install PostgreSQL** (if not already installed).  
2. **Create a new database**:  
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE immigration_db;
   ```
3. **Run DDL Scripts** to set up tables and constraints.  
4. **Execute DML Scripts** to populate sample data.  
5. **Test the queries** for functionality.
6. **View the ER Diagram:**

    The ER Diagram is designed in Dia Diagram Editor.

    Open the .dia file in Dia to visualize the schema.
7. **View the Relational Schema:**

   The Relational Schema is desogned in Dia Diagram Editor.

   Open the .dia file for detailed table relationships and attributes.
